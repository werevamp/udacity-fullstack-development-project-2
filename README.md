#Tournament Results (Udacity Fullstack Development Project)

##Introduction

This project was intended to educate us on an introductory level of database
design. Our goal was to create an application that stores tournament data and
sorts players by using a swiss pairing system.

##Instructions

There are two steps to run this app:

1. Create Database
2. Run the application

###Create Database

The app will not work unless you create the database. To create the database run
the following statement in the command line:

psql -f tournament.sql


###Run the application

Once the database is created you are ready to run the application. To run the
application run the following statement in the command line.

python tournament_test.py
